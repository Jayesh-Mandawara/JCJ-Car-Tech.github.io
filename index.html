      <h2 class="heading4">Introducing About Electronic Vehicles</h2><br>
      <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are automobiles that are propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. They have gained significant popularity in recent years due to advancements in battery technology, environmental concerns, and efforts to reduce dependence on traditional fossil fuels. EVs are generally considered to be more environmentally friendly than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles as they produce no tailpipe emissions.</p>
      <h3>EVs come in various forms:</h3>
      <p>1. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): These run entirely on electric power stored in high-capacity batteries. They need to be recharged by plugging into an electric power source.</p>
      <p>2. Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): Combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and a larger battery, PHEVs can be powered by electricity or gasoline. They offer the flexibility of using either power source.</p>
      <p>3. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs): These vehicles have an internal combustion engine along with an electric motor and a small battery. The battery charges through regenerative braking and the engine, enabling the vehicle to supplement power with electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h3>The benefits of electric vehicles include:</h3>
      <p>- Reduced Environmental Impact: EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, thus helping to decrease air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when powered by clean energy sources.</p>
      <p>- Lower Operating Costs: Electric vehicles typically have lower operating costs compared to traditional vehicles due to cheaper electricity costs and reduced maintenance requirements.</p>
      <p>- Efficiency and Performance: Electric motors provide instant torque, resulting in smooth and swift acceleration. Moreover, they require less maintenance as they have fewer moving parts compared to internal combustion engines.</p>
        
      <p>However, challenges such as limited driving range, longer charging times compared to refueling, and the infrastructure for charging stations are factors that impact the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. Despite these challenges, advancements in technology, improved battery capacities, and the growing infrastructure for charging stations are steadily making electric vehicles more practical and appealing to consumers worldwide.</p>

        <p>A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is a type of electric vehicle that is powered solely by an electric battery and an electric motor, with no internal combustion engine. BEVs are part of the broader category of electric vehicles (EVs), which also includes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).</p><br><br>
         <h1 class="heading1"><strong>Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles</strong></h1><br><br>

         <p>A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery pack can be recharged by plugging a charging cable into an external electric power source, in addition to internally by its on-board internal combustion engine-powered generator. Most PHEVs are passenger cars, but there are also PHEV versions of sports cars, commercial vehicles, vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, motorcycles, mopeds, military vehicles and boats.</p>

         <p>Driving a hybrid car is quite similar to driving a conventional automatic car. However, the performance difference is significant. The common myth regarding hybrid electric vehicles MATLAB simulation is the preconceived notion of the less range provided because of the word electric combined with their names.</p>
         <p>A hybrid electric vehicle or HEV, is the future of automobiles where people can experience gasoline power and electric power in one car. The electric power fuels the motor and the gasoline powers the ICE. This results in an enormous amount of torque and pace for the car.

          They not only provide a better range but also keeps a check over the fuel meter. It is fantastic to have the power of gas fuel and electric energy, which helps maintain your car's efficiency.</p>

          <p>Extended-Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) represent a type of hybrid vehicle that combines aspects of both electric and traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) technologies. The primary distinguishing feature of EREVs is their ability to operate on electric power alone for a significant range before relying on a gasoline-powered generator to extend their overall range. This concept is often associated with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, EREVs have a distinct design and operational focus.</p>

      </section>
      <p>Global warming endangers our health, jeopardizes
        our national security, and threatens other basic
        human needs. Some impacts—such as record high
        temperatures, rising seas, and severe flooding and
        droughts are already increasingly common.</p>
        <p>Our personal vehicles are a major cause of global warming.</p>

                    <li><strong>Vehicular Emissions in World</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The transport sector accounts for a quarter of total emissions, out of which road transport accounts for three-quarters of transport emissions (and 15% of total global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions).</li>
                        <li>Passenger vehicles are the largest chunk of this, releasing about 45% of CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
                        <li>If the conditions prevail, annual GHG emissions in 2050 will be 90% higher than those of 2020.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Vehicular Emissions in India</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically, vehicular emission
                    contributes 20-30% of Particulate
                    Matter (PM) 2.5 at the breathing
                    level of air quality.</li>
                    <li>At the same time, around 8% of total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions in India are from the transport sector, and in Delhi, it exceeds 30%.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
                </p><hr>
                <p><h3>India's Step towards Reducing Emissions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In India, vehicle technology is changing rapidly with changes in fuel quality, exhaust treatment systems of the Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), electrification of vehicle segments and steps towards hydrogen-powered vehicles.</li>
                        <li>It requires substantial tightening of the emissions standards but also modification of technical parameters for testing of vehicles to reduce the emissions in the real world.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The above data is sufficient to explain the urge to electric vehicles.</p>
                <p>Electromobility is considered a technology of the future due to its ecological and environmental advantages.
                Cars powered by electric motors are commonly referred to as zero-emission vehicles by their manufacturers and distributors.
            Various benefits of an electric vehicle over mechanical Cars
        <ul>
            <li>no exhaust fumes – the electric motor produces virtually no pollution, and you can use renewable energy sources, such as your own photovoltaic system, to charge the battery,</li>
    <li>            better performance – electric units in many cases outperform combustion engines in terms of efficiency,</li>
            <li>    simple design and longer life – electric cars are not only regarded as environmentally friendly, but are also less prone to breakdown than their combustion engine counterparts. In addition, servicing such a vehicle is also much quicker,
                smooth, quiet operation,</li>
             <li>   independence from rising fuel prices and supply restrictions,</li>
             <li>   safety – according to many experts, the construction of electric cars, including the absence of a fuel tank, significantly increases the safety of using this type of vehicle.</li>
             <li>possibility to enter low-emission zones</li>
            
        </ul>
        According to a report prepared by the ICCT (International Council of Clean Transport), the carbon footprint of electric cars powered by renewable energy is up to 81% lower than their combustion-powered counterparts. The more kilometres an electric car travels, the faster the “carbon debt” taken on at the battery production stage, among others, will be reduced.</p>

      <p class="p">When we talk about the electric vehicle sector, most of us think 
        about some major automobile makers like Tata Motors or Mahindra 
        Auto but this sector is not just limited to the manufacturers. Based 
        on various parts, segments, and infrastructure used, we can classify 
        the electric vehicles (EV) sectors into four major parts: </p>
    <section id="market">
            <ol>
                <li><b>Auto Manufacturers</b>: This classification includes those 
                    companies that compile all the spare parts and technology to 
                    form a vehicle out of them. </li>
                    <li><b>Auto Parts and EV Software</b>: These include companies that 
                        manufacture spare parts and other technological software that 
                        make EVs smart and technologically advanced. </li>
                        <li><b>Battery Manufacturing</b>: The heart of every EV is the battery 
                            that powers it. A battery is the prime source of energy for an 
                            electric vehicle. </li>
                            <li><b>EV Charging Stations</b>: The battery that powers an EV needs to 
be charged regularly to run the vehicle and therefore this 
classification includes the companies that build the 
infrastructure required to set up charging stations at various 
public places and the residence of the customer as well. 
Based on this segmentation in mind, we have brought a complete 
portfolio of Indian electric vehicles (EV) stocks to look forward to 
in the future. The list includes both, the already listed companies 
and also the newcomers to the market that may turn out to be a 
good choice to invest in. </li>

      <p><strong>Maintenance and Safety of Electric Vehicles</strong></p>
<section id="efficiency">
  <img src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/electric-car-maintenance.jpg"><br>
        <!--Photo of the inside of a hybrid electric vehicle engine.-->
        <p><ol>
    <li>PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) and HEVs (Hybrid Electric Vehicles) require the same general maintenance as
        conventional vehicles.
        <ul>
            <li>It is so because PHEVs and HEVs have internal combustion engines, hence, maintenance requirements are similar to those of
                conventional vehicles.</li>
            <li>The electrical system (battery, motor, and associated electronics) typically requires minimal scheduled
                maintenance, and brake systems generally last longer than those on conventional vehicles because of regenerative braking.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>All-electric vehicles typically require less maintenance than conventional vehicles because:
    <ul>
        <li>They have fewer moving or mechanical parts which require regular maintenance.</li>
<li>The battery, motor, and associated electronics require little to no regular maintenance.</li>
<li>There are fewer fluids, such as engine oil, that require regular maintenance.</li>
<li>Brake wear is significantly reduced due to regenerative braking.</li>
<li>The advanced batteries used in these vehicles have a limited number of charging cycles.<!--On hovering the word cycle "the number of times the battery can be charged and discharged, also called 'cycle life'" should be visible--></li>
    </ul></li>
        <li>Manufacturers design these vehicles and publish guides with a proper standards of maintenance and safety in mind. Some important points for an EV buyer,
            <ul>
                <li>Check with the dealer about battery life and warranties and consider the manufacturer's battery recycling
                    policy. Some automotive battery systems use liquid coolant to maintain safe operating temperatures.
                    These systems may require regular checks. Ask your dealer or refer to your owner's manual for more information.</li>
                <li>The batteries in electric-drive vehicles are generally designed to last for the expected lifetime of the
                    vehicle. Like the engines in conventional vehicles, the advanced batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) are
                    designed for extended life but will wear out eventually. While comprehensive data on EV battery failures is not
                    available, many manufacturers offer 8-year/100,000-mile warranties for their EV batteries.</li>
                <li>Manufacturers typically do not publish pricing for replacement batteries, but if the battery does need to be
                    replaced outside the warranty, it is expected to be a significant expense. However, battery prices are expected
                    to decline as technology improves and production volumes increase.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Safety Standards for an Electric Vehicle
            <ol>
<li>Commercially available electric-drive vehicles must meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
and undergo the same rigorous safety testing as conventional vehicles sold in the United States.
<ul><li>The exception is low-speed electric vehicles (also called neighborhood electric vehicles), which are subject to less-stringent standards because they are typically limited to low-speed roadways as specified by state and local regulations.</li></ul></li>
<li>All-electric vehicles, PHEVs, and HEVs have high-voltage electrical systems that typically range from 400 to 1,000 volts.</li>
<li>Their battery packs are encased in sealed shells and meet testing standards that subject batteries to conditions such as overcharge, vibration, extreme temperatures, short circuit, humidity, fire, collision, and water immersion. Manufacturers design these vehicles with insulated high-voltage lines, and light-duty vehicles are required to have safety features that can deactivate or isolate the electrical system when they detect a collision or short circuit.</li>
<li>All-electric vehicles tend to have a lower center of gravity than conventional vehicles, making them more stable and less likely to roll over.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Emergency Response and Training
            <ol>
                <li>In general, emergency response for electric-drive vehicles is not significantly different from that of conventional vehicles. Most electric-drive vehicles are designed with cutoff switches or have available methods for first responders to isolate the battery and disable the electric system, and high-voltage power cables typically are clearly designated with distinctive coloring or markings (usually orange).</li>
                <li>Many manufacturers publish emergency response guides for their vehicles (see an example from the National Fire Protection Association), and first responders are highly encouraged to reference these guides. The National Fire Protection Association also has training and information resources available at <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/for-professionals/training-for-me/alternative-fuel-vehicles-training/electric-vehicles?l=371">evsafetytraining.org</a>.</li>
                <li>Electric vehicle fires involving the high-voltage battery can present unique challenges to firefighters, often requiring different techniques. First responders should refer to the manufacturer guides and training resources noted above when responding to an electric vehicle incident or fire and should also be aware of the potential for delayed ignition of a damaged vehicle or reignition of a battery fire, even after it is believed to be extinguished.</li>

        <p>Following is the conclusion of the studies conducted by known institutions on vehicle ownership,
          <ul>
          <li>Studies show that around eight percent of total households owns a vehicle in Bharat.</li>
          <li>Out of these owned vehicles, around three-fourth are two wheelers. In other words, majority of the houselholds own two wheeler vehicles.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>A team of five students from SIR M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Management Studies & Research, University of Mumbai prepared a project on Electric Vehicles in which they performed a survey on electric vehicles.
          Here are the conclusions of the survey,
          <ul>
              <li>The survey was conducted among the people, majority of whom own a vehicle and most importantly a two wheeler vehicle.</li>
              <li>Most of the people in this survey prefers their own vehicle when it comes to travel across the city.</li>
              <li>Eighty-five percent of the people in survey were aware of electric/hybrid vehicles.</li>
              <li>Among these around forty-five percent people were willing to convert their vehicle into electric or hybrid vehicles, if given chance.</li>
              <li>The concerns of people after adoption of electric vehicles included its charging, low mileage on a single charge and cost of an electric vehicle.</li>
              <li>Though there were people who were not aware of such technology, but still they showed an eager interest to learn about it, if given a chance.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
  <p>The above survey also included the questions on,
      <ul>
          <li>Affordable price of an electric vehicle and its charging stations</li>
          <li>Required mileage on a single charge</li>
          <li>Charging setups at home or work</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Hence, these questions and people's responses help the system to take initiative so that people are encouraged to adopt a greener technology.
      <ul>
      <li>Government should frame the policies such that the cost of an electric vehicle falls in budget of common people.</li>
      <li>More charging stations especially near offices and at every two to three kilometers distance would ease down their concern of charging their vehicles.</li>
      <li>Policies should be sdopted so that people can charge their vehicles at home too.</li>
      <li>We should make sure that charging of their vehicles does not cost heavily on a pocket of a common man</li>
  </ul>
